# operating systems.
wasm-opt = false
# See wasm-opt for full available options; handy examples:
# -O4 - optimize aggressively for performance
# -Oz - optimize aggressively for code size
# -g - leave debug info in place, allowing for more descriptive stack traces on panic
# --disable-sign-ext - prevents opcodes that the screeps servers can't load (see
